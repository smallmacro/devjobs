## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Tooling
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - React Router
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling component
- Express
- React Query

### What I learned

1. Flexbox or Grid: When aligning items along the main axis, auto margins are the way to go.
2. In tailwind-css `prefers-color-scheme` can be automatically triggered by setting the classname `dark:` or triggered by manually.`window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches` is true in Chrome while is false in Firefox.

   ```javascript
   const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);
   useEffect(() => {
     if (
       checked ||
       localStorage.theme === "dark" ||
       (!("theme" in localStorage) &&
         window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches)
     ) {
       document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
     } else {
       document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
     }

     return () => {};
   }, [localStorage, checked]);
   ```

3. React Router enable to define the `loader` function to load data before loading the component
4. Stop Propagation from children elemement to parent element by using `event.stopPropagation()`
5. Setting Dynamic color tailwind css, such as `bg-[${themeColor}]` , is not working as it against the constraint of Tailwind css. The solution is to set inline-style within the element.
6. [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) is a great tools for testing backend api functions. Can't figure out how to post a Array data .
7. `nodemon` will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.
8. Deleting remote branches.To delete a remote branch, you canâ€™t use the git branch command. Instead, use the git push command with --delete flag, followed by the name of the branch you want to delete. You also need to specify the remote name (origin in this case) after git push.

```
git push origin --delete test
```

9. deploy to fly.io. `fly launch` `fly deploy`
10. Github Pages does not support dynamic route.
11. React router loader function only suggest a timing to preload the data needed to render components, but it does not serve as a cache.
12. Streaming deploying of the frontend

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "build:ui": "rm -rf dist && cd ../frontend && npm run build && cp -r dist/ ../server",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "deploy": "fly deploy",
    "deploy:full": "npm run build:ui && npm run deploy"
  }
}
```

13. redirect the `Express` get requests to `/dist/index.html` to prevent the `can not get /jobs/:id error` when refreshing the path.

### Continued development

- ~~Load json data from backend~~
- ~~configure the base url in react router.~~
- ~~search and filter the jobs~~
- ~~deploy it with a docker.~~(Automatically done while delpoy to flyio)
- Use `React Query` ~~in the loader function~~ as a cache.(done)
- ~~Extract communicaiton with the backend into a seperate module~~
- ~~deploy the whole app to fly.io~~
- Load more request function
- ~~connect the backend to Database(mongoDb)~~
- ~~Implement the CRUD operations in the backend.~~
- ~~Fix the `jobs/:id` path;~~
- ~~Use `mongoose` as mongodb modeling,validation for node.js~~
- Add User profile utillties.(User can register, reset password, update profile, email verificaiton )
- Add Unit test.
